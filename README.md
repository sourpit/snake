# Console Snake Game in ~Assembly~ C

I written the snake game by Serene Dev in C to learn Assembly, And I've got to say that I learned some x86 instructions I didn't knew. I watch Serene Dev video on [youtube](https://youtu.be/QkbXZGEJKaU), and I thought "yea let's make this in C. This will be good to study". And yea I made it with gpt assissted.

Compilation and running:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sourpit/snake.git
$ cd snake
$ make all
$ ./snake
```

Control keys:
```
Esc - quit
h - left
j - down
k - up
l - left
```
